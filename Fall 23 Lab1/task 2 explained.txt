Generally bubble sort runs on O(n^2) time complexity. 
if the data is already sorted then it will run on O(n) time complexity, 
which is known as best case scenerio. Hence to achieve O(n) time complexity, 
we can add a flag to check if the data is already sorted or not. 
If the data is already sorted then we can break the loop and return the data.
